# Fun-with-scraping
A Python, BeautifulSoup and Pandas based project to scrape the top 200 baby names for each decade from 1880-2010 from US census information found online.
Will obtain the top names, and the number of babies with each name in that decade, categorized as male and female.
Output will be generated to a user defined location as a series of text files as structured data frames, for easy statistical analysis/manipulation with R or Pandas.
