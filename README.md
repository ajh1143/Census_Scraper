# Fun-with-scraping
A python, BeautifulSoup and Pandas project to scrape the top 200 baby names for each decade from 1880-2010 from census information.
Will obtain the top names, the number of babies with each name, categorized as male and female.
Output will be generated to a user defined location as a series of text files as structured data frames, for easy statistical analysis/manipulation with R or Pandas.
